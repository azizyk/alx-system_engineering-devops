# 0x0B. SSH
During this project, I learned how to connect to and work with servers via the SSH protocol. I worked on a ALXÂ School-provided server.

## Tasks
- 0. Use a private key

	- use_a_private_key: Bash script that uses ssh to connect to my Holberton-provided server.
- 1. Create an SSH key pair

	- create_ssh_key_pair: Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
- 2-Client configuration file

	- ssh_config: SSH configuration file configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/holberton and to refuse authentication using a password.

- 3. Let me in!
